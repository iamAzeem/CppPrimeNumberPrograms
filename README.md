## Some Facts about Prime Numbers

The following facts are good to know before writing prime numbers' programs:

1. There is only one EVEN prime number i.e. 2.

2. For a prime test, you don't have to test all the numbers. You can test a
   number up to its square root only.

3. The C++ `<cmath>` header provides a
   [`sqrt()`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/math/sqrt) function. Use
   `<math.h>` header for C.
